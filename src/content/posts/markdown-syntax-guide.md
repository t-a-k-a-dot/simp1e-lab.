This guide will show you how to format text using Markdown through a delicious pasta recipe. Let's explore the world of food while learning Markdown syntax!

## Basic Syntax Demonstration

### Heading Levels

In recipes, we often need different levels of headings to organize content. Markdown provides six heading levels:

```markdown
# Classic Garlic Bacon Pasta
## Ingredients Preparation
### Main Ingredients
#### Seasonings
##### Kitchen Tools
###### Tips
```

### Text Formatting

When describing recipes, we often need to emphasize certain important information:

**Important steps** need to be bold
*Critical timing* uses italics
***Special notes*** use both bold and italics
~~Optional steps~~ use strikethrough

```markdown
**Important steps** need to be bold
*Critical timing* uses italics
***Special notes*** use both bold and italics
~~Optional steps~~ use strikethrough
```

### Lists Usage

#### Ingredients List (Unordered List):

- Pasta 400g
- Bacon 200g
  - Preferably with a good mix of fat and lean
  - Cut into small pieces
- Minced garlic 3-4 cloves
- Olive oil 2 tablespoons

```markdown
- Pasta 400g
- Bacon 200g
  - Preferably with a good mix of fat and lean
  - Cut into small pieces
- Minced garlic 3-4 cloves
- Olive oil 2 tablespoons
```

#### Cooking Steps (Ordered List):

1. Boil water with a pinch of salt
2. Add pasta, cook until 80% done
3. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce:
   1. Heat oil in pan
   2. Saut√© minced garlic
   3. Add bacon and stir-fry

   3. Add bacon and stir-fry
```

### Blockquotes

> Chef's tip: Add a bit of olive oil to the boiling water to prevent the pasta from sticking together.
>
> Remember to save some pasta water, it can be used to adjust the sauce consistency.

```markdown

>

```

### Code Blocks

Can be used to show precise ingredient ratios or timing:

```python
# Ingredient Calculator
def calculate_ingredients(servings):
    base_pasta = 100  # grams/person
    base_bacon = 50   # grams/person
    
    return {
        "pasta": base_pasta * servings,
        "bacon": base_bacon * servings
    }
```

### Tables

Nutritional Information:

| Nutrient | Amount (per 100g) | % Daily Value |
|----------|------------------|---------------|
| Calories | 157 kcal         | 7.85%         |
| Protein  | 5.7g             | 9.5%          |
| Carbs    | 21.6g            | 7.2%          |

### Horizontal Rule

Used to separate different content sections:

---

### Inline Code

Pasta cooking time: `8-10 minutes`, maintain an `al dente` texture.

### Math Formulas

Ingredient ratio calculation: $amount = base \ amount \times number \ of \ servings$

Calorie calculation formula:

$$
Total\ calories = \sum(ingredient\ weight \times calories\ per\ gram)
$$

### Task Lists

Preparation checklist:

- [x] Purchase ingredients
- [x] Wash and cut ingredients
- [ ] Prepare cooking utensils
- [ ] Preheat oven

### Footnotes
